# Downloading the Data
<p>
Excel file is downloaded from github to a local data frame (raw_data) and prepared for analysis.<br />
Here the raw data structure can be seen in the manner of the number of variables, variable types and the number of observations.<br/>
There are <b>15 variables</b> and <b>494.305 observations</b> to be conducted.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
### <b> 1. Total Sales vs Customer Segments <small> (1st Graph) </small> </b> 
#### Beauty is more driver than the Fashion and Home. D segment is the highest for contribution to the total sales. 

The first graph in following shows us the total sales for 3 business segments (Beauty, Fashion and Home). <br/>
Accordingly, the main business category of this company is <b>'beauty'</b>, since the majority of sales comes from this group. <b>'Fashion'</b> has also small share in total sales, while <b>'home'</b> share in total is negligible. 

From A to J, there are <b>10 customer segments</b> in total.
The other output out of the first graph is the  contribution amount of every single customer segment to total sales. 

It is showed that, customers in <b> D segment</b> brings <b>the highest contribution</b>; while  F and J segment follow it,respectively.

### <b> 2. Average Sales vs Customer Segments <small> (2nd Graph) </small> </b> 
#### J segment is Atom-Ant. The highest average sales with lower sales contribution to the total sales. 
The second graph shows the average sales for each segment. Once we compare it with the previous one, it results in the fact that, the middle segments have the higher contribution to total sales.

However, <b>J segment</b>, which is <b>the premium one</b>, has the highest average sales among all. The reason is,the number of customers in this premium (J segment) is quite low.But their total sales amount is quite high. Therefore, the average sales of this <b> J segment</b>  is <b> the highest one</b> .

```

### <b> 3. Total Sales based on the City <small> (3rd Graph) </small> </b> 
#### Everybody knows, Istanbul has huge market in Turkey. However, do not underestimate Bursa, please. Bursa is runner-up city.

In the third graph, top 20 cities,based on their total sales amount are showed. <b>Istabul,Bursa</b> and <b>Izmir</b> are in top 3.
 
```{r}
sales_by_city <- 
        project_raw_data %>% 
        group_by(CITY) %>% 
        summarise(total_sales=sum(SALES)) %>% 
        arrange(desc(total_sales)) %>%
        slice(1:20)

glimpse(sales_by_city)

sales_by_city %>% 
                  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(CITY,total_sales), y=total_sales, fill=CITY )) + 
                  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
                  coord_flip()+

```

### <b> 4. Which Days are Popular for Sales? <small> (4th Graph) </small> </b> 
#### The laziest day may be Saturday. Everybody loves Saturday for relaxing. 

In the 4th graph, weekdays are desired to compared with respect to their sales contribution, distributon is given in a pie chart. <br />
Saturday has slightly lower share in a week.


```{r}
sales_per_day <-
        project_raw_data %>% 
        select(INVOICE_DATE,SALES) %>%
        mutate(INVOICE_DATE2=lubridate::as_date(ymd(INVOICE_DATE))) %>%
        mutate(weekday=weekdays(INVOICE_DATE2)) %>%
        group_by(weekday) %>%
        summarise(avg_sale=mean(SALES))  %>%
        mutate(day_order=c(5,6,3,7,1,4,2)) %>%
        arrange(day_order)

glimpse(sales_per_day)

sales_per_day %>%
        ggplot(aes(x=" ",y=avg_sale, fill=reorder(weekday,day_order))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="identity")+
        coord_polar("y",start = 0)+
        theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid  = element_blank())
```

### <b> 5. Which Product Category is the Most Famous? <small> (5th Graph) </small> </b> 
#### The Oscar goes to the <b> Fragrance </b>. Fragrance is very important. If you think not, Please watch the movie "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"

There are sub- categories in each of the business units.To illustrate,<b>'beauty'</b> business category includes 5 different sub-categories; 
such as:
<ul>
  <li> body </li>
  <li> toiletries </li>
  <li> face </li>
  <li> fragnance </li>
  <li> color </li>
</ul>

5th graph in below shows us the share of all these sub-categories in total sales. Bigger area indicates bigger share. <br />
Accordingly, <b> fragnance</b>  is the first, and it is followed by <b>toiletres </b>  and <b>color </b> respectively.


```{r}

categorized_sales <-
  project_raw_data %>% 
  select(CATEGORY_, SALES) %>%
  group_by(CATEGORY_) %>%
  summarise(SALES = sum(SALES)) 

ggplot(categorized_sales, aes(area = SALES, fill = CATEGORY_, label = CATEGORY_)) +
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_text(fontface = "italic", colour = "white", place = "centre", grow = TRUE)+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```
